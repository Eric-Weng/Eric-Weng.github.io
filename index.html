                  I woke up one day loving the idea of making ideas come to life. I'm not sure where the passion came from, but I'm pretty certain it's here to stay. From discord bots to responsive websites,
                  3D models to random software, indie games to video edits, I like doing it all. Nearly nothing excites me more than a blank canvas and an idea.

                <p>
                  Born in Nebraska and raised in Colorado, I recently graduated with a double Bachelors of Arts in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Colorado, Boulder. I am fluent in Mandarin,
                  Cantonese, and English, and I am currently improving my Korean, Spanish, and French skills.

                  When I'm not coding projects, building games, or working on my language skills, I'm hopefully hunting for incredible foods and experiences. Otherwise, I'm probably
                  working through a book next to a cup of tea or grinding video games (Send me book recommendations! I'll read anything. Seriously). Feel free to get in touch with me through
                  my social media linked below!
